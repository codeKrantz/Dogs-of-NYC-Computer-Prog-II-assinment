This assinment was for my computer programming class
We were provided a starter file and were were tasked to sort a csv file infomation. 
We were told to extract the breed of each dog, the number neutered, the number non neutered, and then the percentage neutered dogs per breed.
I reverse engineered the example solution we were given to create my code.

ALTHOUGHT, there is on issue.
When ever I run the code I notice the new csv has some duplicate breeds.
This happened in my code as well as the given solution
Is there a way to fix this problem?
